# Castful

Easily record podcasts on your iPhone and host them on [Contentful][1].

## Usage

1. Create a space on [Contentful][1] which should contain all your beautiful contentâ„¢.

1. The iOS app needs an OAuth client ID and Amazon S3 credentials, put them into the application
delegate for now (will use [cocoapods-keys][3] in the future).

1. Run `make setup` to install the correct version of [CocoaPods][2], etc.

1. The app allows to login, select your space and upload some recorded audio.

1. *Web/index.html* contains a silly little page which displays all casts as `<audio>` tags.
Make sure to put the right space credentials there if you end up using it.
